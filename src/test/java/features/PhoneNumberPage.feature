Feature: Purchase Flow in Chataak Mobile App
  As a mobile app user
  I want to complete a purchase journey
  So that I can buy products successfully

  Scenario: User launches the app and completes a purchase
    Given the mobile app is launched
#    When the user completes onboarding screens
#    And the user logs in with mobile number "8105914136"
#    And the user enters OTP "12345" and verifies
#    And the user selects "Prerana motors ballari (Bellary)" store
#    And the user adds 19 items to cart and buys now
#    And the user selects a random payment option and proceeds
#    Then the user views order history and logs out
